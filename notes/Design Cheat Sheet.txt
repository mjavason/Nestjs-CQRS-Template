Line Height
Headings (1.1x to 1.3x the size in pixels)
Body Text (1.3x - 1.5x the size in pixels)

Letter Spacing
Headings (-1 to -2% the size in pixels)

Text Alignment
Headings (center)
Note: never mix 'center align' header and 'left align' body text.
header center == body center
header aligned == body aligned.
Be consistent

Body Text Limit Recommendations
Anywhere within 50 to 75 characters is okay.

Heirachy
Try to stick to just five different font sizes and use font weight and subtle color changes to indicate heirachy

Spacing
Use Relationships.
if the space between header 2 and body 2 is 1x, the space between header 2 and body 1 should be 2x.

Color
You need only 3 ( use opacity for variety)
Base (Website Background) - good contrast
Primary (CTAs, small details) - good contrast
Neutral (text elements) - light and dark if need be

Visuals (with midjourney AI)
Niche: (agriculture)

Consistency is good, but deviate every now and then so the site looks fresh always. Follow an S or slithering snake shape in your deviations.
